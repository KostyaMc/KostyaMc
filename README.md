- 👀 I’m interested in programming and technology in general, I follow several telegram channels that cover news from the world of technology
- 🌱 I'm currently in 12th grade, I just moved on. I’ve been studying the Python programming language for about 4 months now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the Python language, in particular, I have set a global goal to create my own voice assistant, and this is exactly what I can help with
- 📫 You can contact me email: geimonen68@gmail.com, or telegram messenger using the user @KostyaMc
- ⚡ Fun fact: In Russian, my Kostya is consonant with the word bone, and in childhood I was often called the diminutive affectionately bone
